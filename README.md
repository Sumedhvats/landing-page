# Landing Page Project

This project is a learning exercise focused on HTML and CSS basics, with an emphasis on Flexbox and creating an interactive design. The project involves building a landing page with several sections, including a header, content area, and call-to-action sections, all styled using Flexbox for layout control.

## Features

- **HTML Basics**: Usage of semantic HTML tags like `<div>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<section>`, etc.
- **CSS Flexbox**: Implemented Flexbox for layout management, making it easier to align and distribute space among elements.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adapts to various screen sizes for an optimal user experience.
- **Interactive Design**: Includes buttons with hover effects and a smooth transition to improve user interaction.

## Sections of the Page

1. **Header Section**: Contains a logo and navigation links, aligned using Flexbox for responsive layout.
2. **Content Section**: Includes a title, subtext, and a sign-up button. The section uses Flexbox to align text and an image.
3. **Information Boxes**: Displays random information with boxes arranged using Flexbox.
4. **Quote Section**: Showcases an inspiring quote and its author with centered alignment.
5. **Call-to-Action**: Encourages users to sign up with a prominent button.
6. **Footer**: Includes a copyright notice, styled to match the rest of the page.
